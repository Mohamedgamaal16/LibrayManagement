# LibrayManagement

Here’s how you can write the **Features** and **Future Updates** sections for your GitHub README file:

---

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ **CRUD Operations** for Authors, Books, Publishers, and Borrow Records
* ✅ **RESTful API Endpoints** built with Spring Boot
* ✅ **DTO Usage** for clean and secure data transfer
* ✅ **Exception Handling** for all endpoints
* ✅ **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** enabled for frontend integration
* ✅ **Entity Relationship Management** (Authors ↔ Books ↔ Publishers)
* ✅ **Soft Delete Support** (`force-delete` endpoint for books)
* ✅ **Validation and Error Messaging**
* ✅ **Layered Architecture** (Controller → Service → Repository)
* ✅ **Spring Data JPA Integration**

---

## 🔮 Future Updates

* 🧪 Add unit and integration tests using JUnit & Mockito (working on wright now)
* 🔒 Implement Spring Security for authentication and role-based access
* 📚 Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation for easy API testing
* 💾 Add pagination and filtering for GET endpoints
* 🔁 Implement soft delete functionality for all entities
* 🌍 Add multi-language support for error messages
* 🕵️‍♂️ Add logging using SLF4J & Logback
* 🗃️ Switch to PostgreSQL or MongoDB support
* 📥 Add import/export functionality (CSV/Excel)

Let me know if you'd like a full README template with all sections (title, installation, usage, etc.).

🛠️ Technologies Used

Java 17: Core programming language.
Spring Boot 3: Framework for building the application.
Spring Data JPA: For database interactions.
H2 Database: In-memory database for development and testing.
Maven: Build and dependency management.
Lombok: Reduces boilerplate code.
ModelMapper: Object mapping between DTOs and entities.
Spring Security: Handles authentication and authorization.


Here's a well-organized and professional format to include all your Spring Boot REST API endpoints in your `README.md` file for GitHub:
